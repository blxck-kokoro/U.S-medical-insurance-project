# Medical Insurance Costs Project

## Goal
In this project we will take a closer look at the dataset of patients, who's information about has been gathered (insurance.csv). The main goal is to calculate estimated insurance cost for each patient and focus on analysis of those costs. This data will determine the fundament of our new database - medical records, which has to be clear, legible and flexible in case if some updates will appear. At the end we will analize and sort our own database.

## Technoligies
Project consists of Python 3 code, written in jupyter notebook. I decided to use jupyter in order to explain the process of building our database step by step.

## Launch
* PC 

## Personal information
This is the proposal for Codecademy's U.S Medical Insurance Costs "exercise" project, which plays role as revision after completing the basics of Python course. Moreover this is my first project written since i've began my code learning journey. I'm aware that code contains some bugs and may not be the cleanest out there, however i decided to focus on writing new, better projects, instead of repairing older ones, especially since i don't learn python at the moment, due to other technolgies i want to work on now.
